    <h1>Julia's Plant Tour!</h1>
        <section>
            <p class="intro">Over the past year, during the pandemic and quarantine, a lot of people were trying to find ways to keep themselves busy or just find new hobbies. The thing I picked up during quarantine was plants! I began getting plants and learning how to take care of them. Both of my parents have green thumbs, and I have always grown up around plants, flowers, and gardens. So, this was right down my family's alley. With the help of my mom, I began learning about different plants, how to take care of them, and the different little aspects that greatly differ between each plant.</p>
            <p class="intro bottom">I am still not the best at taking care of plants, but I have gotten better. Now I have a little garden in my room. This will be a small tour of the different plants I have acquired over the past year. A fun, little quirk about my plants, I name every single one of them AND I remember the names.</p>

        <div class="grid-item one">
            <img src="images/spike.jpg" alt="Spike" class="spike">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item two">
            <h3>Spike</h3>
                <p>Spike is a catcus. There are so many types of catcuses that it is hard to really pin-point exactly which type of catcus Spike is. He is my most internesting looking catcus with his long spikes and being bright green.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item three">
            <img src="images/alexander.jpg" alt="Alexander" class="alex">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item four">
            <h3>Alexander</h3>
                <p>I don't know what kind of plant Alexander is. When I bought this plant, it did have a little stick that said what kind of plant he is, but I threw it away. I know he isn't a succulent like the majority of my plants. I think he is more of outdoor garden plant. But, I enjoy the bright colors of this plant!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item five">
            <img src="images/brutus.jpg" alt="Brutus" class="brutus">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item six">
            <h3>Brutus</h3>
                <p>Brutus is a Green Ice Gasteraloe plant, or just an aloe plant for short. This is one of my favorite plants just because of how cool it looks. You can see it in the picture, but the petals are like dark green with little white dots all over them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item seven">
            <img src="images/roy.jpg" alt="Roy" class="roy">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item eight">
            <h3>Roy</h3>
                <p>Roy is a Toyko Sun plant. This is a type of succulent,and succulents are typically easy plants to take care of because they don't require too much care. You water them about once a week, and you set them by a window. I really enjoy having the Toyko Sun plant because how its bright yellow color.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item nine">
            <img src="images/roberto.jpg" alt="Roberto" class="roberto">
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item ten">
            <h3>Roberto</h3>
                <p>Roberto is a disc plant! My mom had a plant like this one, and I really wanted one for myself. When it grows large enough, the discs grow larger and the become more of a hanging plant. This plant is really cool because it is one of the first plants that I began growing from a tiny starter plant. I saw this plant on sale at my local grocery store for like $2.00, and it was in a tiny planter that was about 2 inches wide. Its grown quite a bit since then, and I'll probably have to replant it soon.</p>

        <div class="grid-item eleven">   
            <img src="images/ben.jpg" alt="Ben" class="ben">
        </div> 
        <div class="grid-item twelve">
            <h3>Ben</h3>
                <p>Ben is a Chocolate Soldier plant, which can also be known by many other names depeaning on what it looks like. My specific plant can also be called a Panda Plant. I bought this plant at a farmer's market, and it was one of my very first succulents that started my collected. It is one of my favorites because of how easy it is to care for it and it is super fuzzy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item thirteen">  
            <img src="images/bob.jpg" alt="Bob" class="bob">
        </div>  
        <div class="grid-item fourteen">
            <h3>Bob</h3>
                <p>Bob is one of the super basic succulents that anyone can buy and they probably won't be able to kill it. It is called a Haworthia, or more specifically a Haworthia Liliputiana. This plant is the easiest to care for because it only needs indirect light, so it doesn't need to be right by a window. And it only needs water every couple of weeks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item fifteen"> 
            <img src="images/benedict.jpg" alt="Benedict" class="benedict">
        </div>       
        <div class="grid-item sixteen">
            <h3>Benedict</h3>
                <p>Benedict is a cactus! Like I stated earlier with a previous cactus, there are so many types of cactus that it can be hard to pinpoint the specific type it is. Benedict is my smallest plant and smallest cactus. It's planter can fit perfectly in the palm of my hand. Which is nice for when I am moving around all my plants to water them. This type of plant can exist in a bit more shaded area and be fine. With a cactus, you don't have to water them too much, so they are extremely easy to care for.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item seventeen"> 
            <img src="images/jerry.jpg" alt="Jerry" class="jerry">
        </div>   
        <div class="grid-item eightteen">
            <h3>Jerry</h3>
                <p>Jerry is my last cactus that I own! This was one of the very first plants that I bought to begin my collection with. I started with a cactus because of how simple they are to take care of. Like my other plants, it isn't a large plant and is quite small. It doesn't require too much care or watering. I prefer to keep my plants simple for now until I become a better plant parent!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item nineteen">   
            <img src="images/nigel.jpg" alt="Nigel" class="nigel">
        </div> 
        <div class="grid-item twenty">
            <h3>Nigel</h3>
                <p>Nigel is a monstera plant which have become increasingly popular throughout the past couple of years. There are multiple types of monstera plants. This one is specifically a Monstera Adansonii plant, which is also known as a Swiss Cheese plant due to the holes in the leaves. When I saw this plant at the plant shop I frequent, I immediately bought it because I have always wanted a monstera plant. This plant has been a bit more difficult to take care of compared to my succulents.</p>
